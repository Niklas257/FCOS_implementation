# FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage) Object Detection Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the **FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage)** object detection model, developed as part of a university seminar. The project also includes the implementation of a **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** detection head, which can be found in the notebook. The primary focus, however, was on implementing and training the FCOS model, inspired by the original [FCOS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355).

## Overview

- **Objective**: Implement the FCOS object detection model and a DETR detection head from scratch.
- **Challenge**: The project involved working with image representations and bounding box annotations, which required extensive data transformations. Efficient handling of these transformations was critical to managing training with limited computational resources.
- **Results**: While the model demonstrates learning (as shown in the visualizations in the notebook), it did not fully achieve the desired results. However, this challenging problem provided valuable insights into deep learning and the complexities of working with object detection tasks.

## Repository Contents

- **Notebook**: The notebook includes:
  - Implementation details of the FCOS model and DETR detection head.
  - Visualizations of the model's learning progress.
  - Insights into the challenges faced during training.
- **Code**: A from-scratch implementation of:
  - FCOS object detection model.
  - DETR detection head.
  - Data preprocessing and transformation pipelines.

## Key Takeaways

- This project was an excellent opportunity to dive deep into object detection and understand the intricacies of models like FCOS, ResNet and DETR.
- New appreciation for the difficulties of working with image data and bounding box representations, as well as the importance of efficient data handling.
